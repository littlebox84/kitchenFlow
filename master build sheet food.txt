### ✅ This sheet is now your single source of truth for v1.1

*Use it to seed the app’s build‑card JSON, quizzes, and plating reference images.*
If you need starters, salads, pizzas, or dinner entrées added in the same format, just say the word!


### 🔧 Last‑minute build corrections (v1.1.1)

I’ve updated the master sheet to lock in your latest tweaks for the **Chicken Parmesan** and **Bacon Jam Pulled Pork** sandwiches.

## 🥪 Sandwiches (revised rows)

| Sandwich                  | Ordered Build (bottom → top)                                                                                           | Garnish   |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| **Chicken Parmesan**      | Ciabatta (bot) → **Crispy chicken breast** → **Marinara** → **Mozzarella** → **Parmesan sprinkle** → Ciabatta (top)    | 3 pickles |
| **Bacon Jam Pulled Pork** | Ciabatta (bot) → **Pulled pork** → **Crispy onions** → Ciabatta (top ‑ underside spread with **bacon‑pepper jam**)\*\* | 3 pickles |

*All other sandwich builds remain as listed in v1.1.*

### What changed?

1. **Chicken Parmesan order:** chicken first, then marinara, mozzarella, parmesan.
2. **Bacon Jam Pulled Pork:** bacon‑pepper jam now lives on the **top bun**, crispy onions sit directly on pulled pork.

These updates are reflected in the PRD’s content table (§ 6.2) and will flow into the app’s build‑card data. Let me know if any other tweaks pop up—otherwise we’re locked for code!

## 4. Kitchen Operations & Safety
### 4.1 Daily Closing Checklist
- Tasks include cleaning the grill, sauté station, fryers, floors, and performing a final equipment and safety walk-through.  
- Checklist is interactive, allowing staff to mark tasks as completed.  

### 4.2 Weekly Deep-Clean Tasks

- **Tuesday**: Clean behind coolers.  
- Tasks are tracked to ensure completion and compliance.  

### 4.3 Kitchen Policies
- Rules cover personal hygiene, staff meals, music, and break times.  
- Accessible within the app for quick reference.  

---

## 5. User Experience (UX) & Design
### 5.1 Theme
- **Dark Mode Only**: Use a dark charcoal or slate background for a modern, clean, and warm aesthetic.  
- Incorporate subtle gradients and soft "glow" effects on selected items or hovered buttons for a premium feel.  

### 5.2 Navigation
- Primary left-to-right dropdown menu for seamless access to all modules (Training, Quiz, PrepBoard, etc.).  
- Touch-friendly design with large tap targets optimized for a fast-paced kitchen environment.  

### 5.3 Layout
- Responsive and modern, avoiding outdated or cluttered designs.  
- Prioritize usability with clear typography and intuitive navigation.  

---

## 6. Technical Specifications
### 6.1 Architecture
- **Offline-First Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Fully functional without an internet connection after initial load.  
- Uses service workers to cache assets and ensure offline reliability.  

### 6.2 Data Source
- All data (menu items, prep tasks, cleaning checklists, policies) is stored in local CSV files located in the `/public/build_sheets/` directory.  
- No external database dependencies.  

### 6.3 Persistence
- User progress (quiz scores, viewed flashcards, PrepBoard entries) is stored in the browser’s `localStorage` for persistence across sessions.  

### 6.4 Tech Stack
- **Framework**: React (Next.js) for fast, component-based development.  
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety and scalability.  
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for rapid, utility-first styling.  
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui for consistent, modern UI elements.  

---

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: App must load within 2 seconds on modern devices, even offline.  
- **Accessibility**: Support for screen readers and high-contrast visuals for accessibility.  
- **Security**: No external API calls or sensitive data storage; all data is local and secure.  
- **Scalability**: CSV-based data allows easy updates to menu items or tasks without code changes.  

---

## 8. Future Considerations
- **Analytics**: Track user engagement (e.g., quiz performance, module completion) for training insights.  
- **Multilingual Support**: Add support for additional languages to accommodate diverse staff.  
- **Cloud Sync**: Optional cloud backup for progress if internet is available.

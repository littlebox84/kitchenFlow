Below is a ready-to-paste Safety & Compliance "Quick Reference" set for your KitchenFlow Trainer.
I formatted each item to match the existing QuickRefItem shape (name | type | details | category).
Drop this array into the same mock-data-file you're already using (or load it from JSON) and point the Quick Ref page at it.
If you'd rather give Safety its own nav entry, just create /safety/page.tsx and render these items there instead.

How to wire it up quickly
Data

Save the snippet as /public/data/safetyQuickRef.json (or a TS file in /src/lib).

Import & merge with the existing mock data:

ts
Copy
Edit
import { safetyQuickRef } from "@/public/data/safetyQuickRef";
const quickRefItems = [...existingQuickRef, ...safetyQuickRef];
UI

Option A: keep everything on /quick-ref and add a category filter chip ("Safety").

Option B: duplicate quick-ref/page.tsx to /safety/page.tsx, pull only Safety & Compliance categories, and add a sidebar link:

ts
Copy
Edit
{ icon: ShieldCheck, label: "Safety", href: "/safety" }
Future-proofing

All facts cite the latest publicly available MDH or USDA guidance.

MN Food Code is slated for a full revision beginning late 2025; mark a 2026-Q1 task to audit this list then.
